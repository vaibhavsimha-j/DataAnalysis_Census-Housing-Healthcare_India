# DataAnalysis_Census-Housing-Healthcare_India

This repository contains a collection of 26 real-world data analysis problem statements, solved using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
The tasks involve data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation from Indian census, housing, and healthcare datasets.
By completing these exercises, the project demonstrates intermediate-level data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization skills, building a strong foundation for a career in data analytics.

## Problem Domains

The repository covers the following domains:
	•	Census Data (2011) → Cleaning, renaming, handling missing values, demographic insights
	•	Housing Data → Rural vs Urban housing quality, amenities, livability analysis
	•	Hospital Data → Facility distribution, bed availability, healthcare disparity analysis
	•	Government Hospital Data → Resource gaps, policy recommendations, WHO standard checks
	•	AYUSH Hospitals → Utilization, accessibility, and integration into healthcare system

## Key Problem Statements (Highlights from 26 PS)

  •	Cleaning and standardizing 2011 Census Data (states, UTs, nomenclature, missing values)
  •	Processing housing data to compute absolute values from percentages
	•	Visualizing toilet availability, rural vs urban population ratio, and household conditions
	•	Analyzing hospital and government hospital data for disparities
	•	Checking compliance with WHO standards (3 beds per 1000 people)
	•	Identifying states most in need of new government hospitals
	•	Evaluating population density, gender literacy gaps, and healthcare accessibility
	•	Correlating demographics (age, literacy, gender) with hospital needs
